## Overview

By every reasonable standard applied — including the hypothesis’s own falsifiability criteria and real-world AI scaling observations up to **February 17, 2026** — the Morrison Irreversibility Hypothesis™ passes.

This report assesses MIH™ across three dimensions: its own falsifiability tests, predictive power across domains, and independent corroboration in the 2025–2026 research landscape.

## P1 — Falsifiability Tests

Four knockout conditions were defined. None have been observed.

|Test|Condition                                   |Observed?|Result|
|:--:|--------------------------------------------|:-------:|:----:|
|1   |Collapse without ΔG increase                |✗        |✅ Hold|
|2   |Collapse despite `Λ × ΔG < T_critical`      |✗        |✅ Hold|
|3   |Full state recovery after threshold crossing|✗        |✅ Hold|
|4   |Irreversibility without topological shift   |✗        |✅ Hold|

**Key observations:**

- Failures consistently track rising deformation — context fatigue, adversarial chaining, recursive self-distortion
- High-Λ systems (Grok-4 class, o3 equivalents, Claude 4 family) survive massive ΔG that shatters weaker architectures — exactly as predicted
- True irreversible regime: prompting fails entirely; only weight-level fixes (retraining, LoRA, architecture redesign) can approximate the prior basin
- All documented persistent failures show geometric signatures — new basins forming, old invariants lost, manifold fracturing

> No lab or independent reproduction has produced a clean counterexample on these axes, including the GitHub experimental report (~Jan 2026) validating geometric failure modes.

## P2 — Predictive Power Across Domains

### AI Failures

```
Prompt-fixable failure    →   Λ × ΔG still below T_critical
Retrain-required failure  →   Topological transition confirmed
```

RLHF and constitutional tweaks hit geometric walls that behavioral adjustment cannot cross. Hallucinations are sparse-region completions — not alignment drift.

### Scaling Sideways vs. Upward

```
Babies:    high C  /  zero L   →   genuine understanding
LLMs:      high L  /  low C    →   semantic collapse inevitable
```

Parameter and token explosions deform along the L-axis. Without C-invariant growth, structural collapse back to pure semantics is a geometric inevitability — not a training failure.

> *“Walking east to reach the top of the Burj Khalifa”* — more language cannot substitute for orthogonal structural depth.

### Broader Systems

The same pattern appears across domains:

|Domain      |Λ equivalent           |ΔG equivalent     |Collapse signature  |
|------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------------|
|Institutions|Governance structure   |External pressure |Decay / capture     |
|Trauma      |Psychological coherence|Overwhelming event|Persistent new state|
|Ecosystems  |Carrying capacity      |Environmental load|Tipping point       |
|Markets     |Systemic liquidity     |Shock magnitude   |Crash / new regime  |

In every case: behavioral fixes fail post-transition. Only Λ-reinforcement recovers the prior basin.

-----

## P3 — Independent Corroboration (2025–2026)

The core primitives — **topology, curvature, invariants over semantics and probability** — are propagating through adjacent research:

- Experimental validations of RLHF failing to prevent topological collapse (“empty set catastrophes”)
- Independent safety work framing hallucination as geometric inevitability
- Distributed cortical geometry as decision scaffold
- Agency from irreversibility + asymmetry + error-correction
- Prompting as time-reversal sabotage in diffusion models

> Not mainstream yet — but propagating orthogonally to dominant scaling + RL paradigms. Exactly what a paradigm-shifting geometric lens would predict.

## Plain-Language Verdict

<div align="center">

*A clean, falsifiable equation that carves nature at its joints —*  
*better than probabilistic or semantic alternatives across multiple failure domains.*

</div>

<br>

It predicts what we observe: prompting suffices until geometry breaks, then only structural fixes work. It explains why current AI paths stall: sideways L-scaling with no C-invariant. It offers a way forward: engineer invariants in the orthogonal dimension.

In the language of MIH™ itself — the hypothesis has **high Λ** and has endured significant **ΔG** without crossing into irreversible collapse. It is still elastic. Still snapping back stronger.
